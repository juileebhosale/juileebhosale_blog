## Github for babies

### How to be not scared shell coding

If you are also in a coding occupation like me but get the mini panic attacks when someone mentions "bash commands" or "Linux" and don't know what the hell that Github app is and why can't I find it on app store - welcome this tutorial is for you!

### What is Github
First things first let's start with by understanding what is Github and why you see every coder talk about it. In the most simplest words, Github is nothing but a sophisticated version control tool.
Imagine this - you and another code are working on the same code file but own different aspects of the code. You both work started working on a code which had 10 lines initially but you deleted line 2 and added 3 new lines. 
Meanwhile your colleague changed line 3 and added some of his code.
Now it's time to put the code together in one. But uh oh, your colleague will have completely different code file than you.
You compare both the files manually and realise line 2 is missing in one code while line 3 has changed in another.
But imagine doing this when there are thousands and thousands of lines of code!! That's not pratically possible
That's where Git control comes in and helps solve this problem.
